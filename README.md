# REACT CHALLENGE

My react challenge is inside the folder "react-challenge", where I created a search engine to look for gifs, from GIPHY.com.
The edited code is:

1.src/index.js
2.src/index.css
3.src/components/search.js
4.src/components/SelectedList.js
5.src/components/SelectedListItem.js

A big thank you to James for this oportunity and challenge. I had lot's of fun coding with React.js! :)
