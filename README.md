# Giphy.com Search Engine

This is a Search Engine created with React.js, where the user can search for gifs with Giphy API. I learned to develop this tool through this tutorial right here: https://tighten.co/blog/react-101-building-a-gif-search-engine 

The search engine still needs some improvements, but I will fix the issues with time. 

The tutorial is easy to follow and explains all the code properly! :D
