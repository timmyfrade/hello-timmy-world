Welcome to James Front-end Challenge

This challenge serves to evaluate your level of proficiency in React and your capacity to solve a day-to-day problem.

In this app you will find a **non working** search engine.
Your job is to **fix it** and **improve it**.

You just need to clone this repo and start working on it.
After you've finish, just send us the link of your repo by email so we can evaluate.

This Challenge was bootstrapped with Create React App.
Check this [README](https://github.com/CrowdProcess/react-challenge/blob/master/CreateReactApp.md) for more information in how to run the project and tests.

#### TODO

1. Fix or write components.
2. Make the components look great with CSS (use [flexbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj7NZ6FiQvo&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7xj_y6NIAhy0wuCd4uVdid)).

##### Bonus
  3. Replace the get list function in ```App``` by a request to a server using [fetch](https://github.github.io/fetch/) or [react-refetch](https://github.com/heroku/react-refetch).
  4. Add more tests.
